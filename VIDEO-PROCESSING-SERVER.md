# Scandi Video AI — Video Processing Server

## Overview

An Express/TypeScript server that runs on a DigitalOcean Droplet and processes video segment clips. It subscribes to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic for real-time crop jobs, and also provides backfill scripts for batch processing existing segments.

For each segment, the server:

1. Generates a short-lived signed URL for the source video and asks FFmpeg to read directly from it over HTTPS (HTTP range requests pull only the bytes for the segment + lookahead instead of the whole file). Falls back to downloading the whole source into the LRU disk cache only when streaming fails — typically MP4s where the `moov` atom isn't at the start of the file.
2. Crops the segment using FFmpeg stream copy (no re-encoding, 2–5 seconds per clip)
3. Uploads the clip to both Firebase Storage and Cloudflare Stream in parallel
4. Updates the Firestore segment document with clip URLs and status

- **Runtime:** Node.js, TypeScript, Express
- **Deployment:** DigitalOcean Droplet via PM2
- **FFmpeg mode:** Stream copy (`-c copy`) with 2s padding before and after
- **Source access:** HTTP streaming from a Firebase signed URL (primary); local LRU disk cache (fallback)

## Architecture

```
Google Cloud Pub/Sub (topic: segment-crop-jobs)
        ↓  pull subscription
VideoProcessingServer (DigitalOcean Droplet)
        ↓
1. Generate a 1-hour signed read URL for the source video in Firebase Storage
2. FFmpeg stream copy from URL (HTTP range requests):
     -reconnect 1 -seekable 1 -ss {start-2s} -i {signedUrl} -t {duration+4s} -c copy
   ↳ Fallback: if FFmpeg can't range-seek the source (e.g. non-faststart MP4
     where the moov atom is at the end), download the whole file into the
     LRU cache on the mounted volume and crop from local disk instead.
3. Upload clip to Firebase Storage (clips/{segmentId}.mp4)
4. Upload clip to Cloudflare Stream (tus resumable protocol)
5. Update Firestore segment: clipStatus "processing", clipCloudflareUid, clipDownloadUrl
        ↓
Cloudflare transcodes → webhook/periodic sync confirms "ready"
```

## Services

### `config/env.ts` — Environment Variables

Validates all env vars at startup using Zod. Exits with a clear error if any are missing.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | Yes | — | Google Cloud project ID |
| `GCP_KEY_FILE` | Yes | — | Path to service account JSON on the Droplet |
| `PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION` | No | `segment-crop-worker` | Pub/Sub subscription name |
| `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Yes | — | Firebase Storage bucket name |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` | Yes | — | Cloudflare account ID |
| `CF_API_TOKEN` | Yes | — | Cloudflare API token with Stream permissions |
| `VIDEO_CACHE_DIR` | No | `/mnt/video-cache` | Persistent directory for cached source videos |
| `VIDEO_CACHE_MAX_GB` | No | `80` | Max cache size in GB; LRU eviction when exceeded. Set to 0 to disable eviction |
| `CLIP_OUTPUT_DIR` | No | `/tmp/clips` | Temporary directory for FFmpeg output |
| `DEPLOY_SECRET` | No | `""` | GitHub webhook secret for auto-deploy endpoint |
| `PORT` | No | `3000` | HTTP server port |

### `services/pubsub.ts` — Pub/Sub Subscriber

- Connects to the `segment-crop-worker` pull subscription using the service account key
- Flow control: `maxMessages: 8` (processes up to 8 segments concurrently). Since crops now stream from a signed URL instead of thrashing the disk, network + small bursts of CPU are the bottleneck, not disk I/O
- On message: parses JSON payload, calls `processSegment()`, then `message.ack()` on success or `message.nack()` on failure
- Pub/Sub automatically retries `nack`ed messages with backoff
- The 600s ack deadline prevents Pub/Sub from re-delivering while FFmpeg + upload is still running

**Message format (from Cloud Function):**

```json
{
  "segmentId": "abc123",
  "videoStoragePath": "videos/C0624.MP4",
  "startSeconds": 225,
  "endSeconds": 241
}
```

### `services/ffmpeg.ts` — FFmpeg Crop

- Uses `child_process.execFile` to run FFmpeg (no shell, safer)
- **Stream copy mode:** `-c copy` (no re-encoding, near-instant regardless of source file size)
- **Fast seeking:** `-ss` placed before `-i` so FFmpeg seeks by byte offset, not by decoding
- **2-second padding:** adds 2s before `startSeconds` and 2s after `endSeconds` for clean cuts. A segment at 225s–241s becomes a clip from 223s–243s
- Start time clamped to 0 (won't go negative for clips at the beginning of a video)
- Timeout: 120 seconds per crop
- Output: `{CLIP_OUTPUT_DIR}/{segmentId}.mp4`

**FFmpeg command:**

```bash
ffmpeg -ss 00:03:43 -i /mnt/video-cache/abc123.mp4 -t 20 -c copy -y /tmp/clips/segmentId.mp4
```

### `services/firebase.ts` — Firebase Admin SDK

- Initializes with the service account JSON key
- **`downloadVideo(storagePath, destPath)`** — streams the file to disk using `createReadStream().pipe(writeStream)` (memory-safe for 6GB+ files, no buffering)
- **`uploadClip(localPath, segmentId)`** — uploads to `clips/{segmentId}.mp4` in Firebase Storage, returns a signed download URL (expires 2030)
- **`updateSegmentDoc(segmentId, clipData)`** — updates the Firestore segment document with clip metadata + `clipProcessedAt` server timestamp

### `services/cloudflare.ts` — Cloudflare Stream Upload

- Uses the **tus resumable upload protocol** via `tus-js-client`
- **Chunked:** 50 MB chunks (Cloudflare's recommended size for reliable connections)
- **Resumable:** if a chunk fails, it retries from where it left off (retry delays: 1s, 3s, 5s, 10s)
- **Streaming:** reads the file via `fs.createReadStream`, never buffers the entire clip in memory
- **Metadata:** includes `segmentId` in tus upload metadata so the Cloudflare webhook can identify which segment the clip belongs to. Also sets `requireSignedURLs: "false"` so clips are publicly playable
- **UID parsing:** extracts the Cloudflare Stream UID from the tus response URL pathname (strips `?tusv2=true` query string via `new URL().pathname`)

### `services/video-cache.ts` — Persistent LRU Video Cache

Source videos (6GB+) are expensive to download. The cache ensures each video is downloaded only once and persists across server restarts.

- **Persistent storage:** defaults to `/mnt/video-cache` (a mounted DigitalOcean Volume, not `/tmp`)
- **LRU eviction:** when cache exceeds `VIDEO_CACHE_MAX_GB`, deletes the least-recently-used files first. Each access touches the file's mtime so frequently-used videos stick around
- **No time-based cleanup:** videos stay cached forever until disk space is needed
- **Download deduplication:** concurrent requests for the same video share a single download (in-memory promise map)
- **Startup logging:** on boot, logs cache stats: `Video cache: 15 videos, 42.30 GB used (80 GB limit) at /mnt/video-cache`
- **Cache key:** MD5 of the `videoStoragePath`, preserving the original file extension
- **`clearCache()`:** removes all cached files (used by backfill scripts after completion)

### `worker/segment-processor.ts` — Pipeline Orchestrator

Processes a single segment end-to-end:

1. Try to crop directly from a Firebase signed URL (no download). If FFmpeg fails (typically because the source's index is at the end of the file and can't be range-seeked), fall back to downloading the full source into the LRU disk cache and crop locally.
2. Crop with FFmpeg (stream copy, ±2s padding)
3. Upload clip to Firebase Storage and Cloudflare Stream **in parallel** (`Promise.allSettled` — both uploads run to completion before cleanup)
4. Delete the temporary clip file
5. Update Firestore segment document with `clipStoragePath`, `clipDownloadUrl`, `clipCloudflareUid`, `clipStatus: "processing"`

Uses `Promise.allSettled` instead of `Promise.all` to prevent a crash where one upload fails and the clip file is deleted while the other upload's ReadStream is still reading from it.

### `routes/deploy.ts` — GitHub Auto-Deploy Webhook

- **POST `/deploy`** — receives GitHub push webhooks
- Verifies the `x-hub-signature-256` header using HMAC-SHA256 with `DEPLOY_SECRET`
- Only triggers on `push` events; ignores other event types
- Executes `deploy.sh` in the project directory (git pull, npm install, build, PM2 restart)
- Responds immediately with `{ "message": "Deploy started" }` so GitHub doesn't time out

### `routes/health.ts` — Health Check

- **GET `/health`** — returns `{ "status": "ok", "uptime": <seconds> }`
- Used for monitoring and verifying the server is reachable

---

## Firestore Fields Written

After processing, these fields are added to the segment document:

| Field | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `clipStoragePath` | `clips/abc123.mp4` | Path in Firebase Storage |
| `clipDownloadUrl` | `https://storage.googleapis.com/...` | Signed download URL |
| `clipCloudflareUid` | `24c23854e3f1...` | Cloudflare Stream video UID |
| `clipStatus` | `processing` | Initial status; updated to `ready` by webhook/periodic sync |
| `clipProcessedAt` | Firestore Timestamp | When FFmpeg processing completed |

Additional fields set by Cloud Functions (not the worker):

| Field | Set By | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `clipCloudflareThumbnailUrl` | Webhook / Periodic Sync | Thumbnail URL once CF confirms ready |
| `clipSyncAttempts` | Periodic Sync | Retry counter for failed CF uploads |
| `clipSyncError` | Webhook / Periodic Sync | Error reason (deleted on success) |

---

## Scripts

### `npm run backfill` — Remote Backfill

Processes all unprocessed segments by downloading source videos from Firebase Storage.

```bash
npm run backfill
```

- Queries all segments where `clipStatus` does not exist
- Groups by `videoStoragePath` so each source video is downloaded once
- Processes segments sequentially within each group
- Clears the video cache after completion

### `npm run backfill:local` — Local Backfill

Processes segments using local video files (no Firebase Storage download). Designed for initial bulk processing when you have the source videos on the same machine.

```bash
# Process only unprocessed segments
npm run backfill:local

# Re-process ALL segments (override previous results)
npm run backfill:local -- --force
```

- Resolves videos from `VideoDataExtractorV1/videos/` by extracting the filename from `videoStoragePath` (e.g. `videos/C0624.MP4` → `C0624.MP4`)
- Falls back to the `videoFileName` field if `videoStoragePath` doesn't resolve
- Reports exactly which segments were skipped and why (missing fields vs. video not found locally)
- `--force` flag processes all segments regardless of current `clipStatus`

### `npm run fix:signed-urls` — Fix Signed URL Requirement

One-time fix script for clips that were uploaded with `requireSignedURLs` accidentally enabled (caused by incorrect tus metadata key casing).

```bash
npm run fix:signed-urls
```

- Queries all segments with a `clipCloudflareUid`
- Calls `POST /stream/{uid}` on Cloudflare API with `{ requireSignedURLs: false }` for each
- No re-upload needed — this is a metadata-only update on Cloudflare's side

---

## Deployment on DigitalOcean

### Server Requirements

- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Plan:** 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM ($24/mo) — more than enough for stream-copy FFmpeg
- **Software:** Node.js 22+, FFmpeg, PM2
- **Storage:** DigitalOcean Volume for video cache (100 GB = $10/mo)

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Install FFmpeg
sudo apt install -y ffmpeg

# Install Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Install PM2
sudo npm install -g pm2

# Upload the project and service account key
# Configure .env from .env.example

# Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# Start with PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### Storage Expansion (DigitalOcean Volume)

The Droplet's built-in 35 GB disk is not enough for caching 100+ GB of source videos. Attach a DigitalOcean Volume:

| Volume size | Monthly cost |
|---|---|
| 100 GB | $10/mo |
| 150 GB | $15/mo |
| 200 GB | $20/mo |

```bash
# 1. Create volume in DO Console: Dashboard → Volumes → Create → same region as Droplet

# 2. Format and mount
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0DO_Volume_your-volume-name
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/video-cache
sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0DO_Volume_your-volume-name /mnt/video-cache

# 3. Auto-mount on reboot
echo '/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0DO_Volume_your-volume-name /mnt/video-cache ext4 defaults,nofail,discard 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# 4. Give worker user ownership
sudo chown -R worker:worker /mnt/video-cache
```

Set in `.env`:
```
VIDEO_CACHE_DIR=/mnt/video-cache
VIDEO_CACHE_MAX_GB=80
```

### Firewall

Port 3000 must be open for the health check and GitHub deploy webhook:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3000
```

Also check DigitalOcean Cloud Firewall in Networking dashboard if applicable.

### PM2 Configuration (`ecosystem.config.js`)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Process name | `segment-worker` |
| Script | `dist/server.js` |
| Instances | 1 |
| Auto-restart | Yes |
| Max memory | 1 GB (restarts if exceeded) |

### Useful Commands

```bash
pm2 logs segment-worker              # Live logs
pm2 logs segment-worker --lines 100  # Last 100 lines
pm2 restart segment-worker            # Restart after code update
pm2 monit                             # Real-time CPU/memory dashboard
curl http://localhost:3000/health     # Health check
```

### Auto-Deploy via GitHub Webhook

The server has a `/deploy` POST endpoint that triggers automatic deployment on git push:

1. Set `DEPLOY_SECRET` in `.env` to match your GitHub webhook secret
2. In GitHub repo: Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook
   - URL: `http://YOUR_DROPLET_IP:3000/deploy`
   - Content type: `application/json`
   - Secret: same as `DEPLOY_SECRET`
   - Events: Just the push event
3. Create a `deploy.sh` script in the project root on the Droplet

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Stream copy (`-c copy`) instead of re-encoding** — crops are near-instant (2–5 seconds) regardless of source file size because FFmpeg only copies the byte range, no decoding/encoding. The tradeoff is slightly imprecise keyframe-aligned cuts, which the ±2s padding compensates for.

2. **tus resumable uploads for Cloudflare** — clips from high-bitrate source videos can be 50–100+ MB. The tus protocol uploads in 50 MB chunks with automatic retry, preventing the connection-reset failures that occur with single-shot POST uploads.

3. **`Promise.allSettled` for parallel uploads** — Firebase Storage and Cloudflare Stream uploads run in parallel for speed, but `allSettled` ensures both complete (or fail) before the temporary clip file is deleted. `Promise.all` would reject immediately on first failure, leaving the other upload's ReadStream reading a deleted file.

4. **Pub/Sub over Firestore jobs collection** — Pub/Sub provides automatic retry with backoff, dead-letter support, exactly-once delivery option, and decouples the Cloud Function from the worker. The 600s ack deadline accommodates slow video downloads + FFmpeg + upload.

5. **Persistent LRU video cache** — source videos (6GB+) are cached on a mounted DigitalOcean Volume so each video is only downloaded once. LRU eviction (based on file mtime) kicks in when disk usage exceeds `VIDEO_CACHE_MAX_GB`, removing the least-recently-accessed videos first. Concurrent download requests for the same video are deduplicated via an in-memory promise map.

6. **Streaming downloads** — large source videos are downloaded via `createReadStream().pipe(writeStream)` instead of `file.download()` to avoid buffering 6GB+ in Node.js memory.

7. **`clipStatus: "processing"` not `"ready"`** — the worker sets `"processing"` because Cloudflare still needs to transcode the uploaded clip. The existing webhook and periodic sync Cloud Functions then confirm `"ready"` once Cloudflare finishes, using the same three-layer resilience pattern as full videos.

8. **2-second padding** — FFmpeg stream copy can only cut on keyframes, which may not align exactly with the requested timestamps. The ±2s padding ensures the actual content is fully captured even if the nearest keyframe is slightly before/after the requested time.

9. **`requireSignedURLs: "false"` in tus metadata** — ensures clips are publicly playable via Cloudflare Stream without requiring signed tokens. The metadata key must be exact camelCase (`requireSignedURLs`, not `requiresignedurls`).

10. **Concurrency limit (`maxMessages: 2`)** — only 2 Pub/Sub messages are processed at once. Each involves disk I/O (video download, FFmpeg, upload), so higher concurrency risks saturating the Droplet's network and disk. Safe to increase to 3–4 if you upgrade the Droplet.
